# CSVtoSQL

CSVtoSQL is a Python 3 script to parse a CSV file into SQL INSERT statements.

## Usage
It requires PYTHON 3 to run and requires csv file in the same directory.
Upon running the CSVtoSQL.py script it will prompt to enter the csv file name (e.g."import.csv") and the name of the database.
It will then ask to enter row numbers that does not require quotation marks separated by commas (e.g. enter 1,2 to have first and second column values with quotation marks.)
The SQL script will be generated in the same directory where the Python script is.
